<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c005'><span class='sc'>From the dawn of history</span> <i>to the present, men have
labored unceasingly to surround their homes with impregnable
fortifications while at the same time they have tried to discover more
powerful weapons to smash through the defenses of other men. The
Romans and the Chinese had their great walls; the feudal lords of the
Middle Ages had their moated castles; and to modern times belong
the Maginot and the Siegfried Lines and the atom bombs. In these
great efforts, and countless others like them, man has confidently
sought permanent security. But no man or nation has yet devised a
refuge safe against new weapons and new tactics of a determined
enemy. The age-old struggle between offense and defense is the
principal story of Fort Pulaski.</i></p>

</div>

<p class='c003'>After gathering its waters from the high valleys and slopes of the
Appalachian Mountains, the Savannah River follows a course south-eastward
300 miles to the sea and forms a natural boundary between
South Carolina and Georgia. Plunging swiftly through narrow gorges
or drowsing through cypress swamps, this brown-red river moves onward
past pine-crested hills and smothered plains. Twelve miles from
the sea it leaves the firm land to sweep in lazy coils across a vast and
quivering marsh. Here the river splits into two channels divided by low
grassy islets almost completely submerged twice daily by the rising of
the tide. The easternmost of these islets, a mile long by less than half a
mile wide, is known as Cockspur Island from the shape of its dangerous
reef that juts out toward the open sound.
<span class='pageno' title='1' id='Page_1'></span>Within sight of the Atlantic Ocean, Cockspur guards the two entrances
into the Savannah River, one of the Nation’s great avenues
of commerce. Despite the fact that very few of its hundred or more
acres lie above the highwater mark, this island has played a significant
role in the economic development and military defense of coastal
Georgia throughout the history of colony and state. The island was
considered so important that one Royal Governor called it the “Key
to Our Province,” and 20 acres on the eastern point were permanently
set aside by the Crown and later by the State as a site for harbor
fortifications.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='2' id='Page_2'></span>To the north and south of Cockspur lie the barrier islands of the
Carolina and Georgia coasts. On these great islands, and on mainland
plantations across the marshes, aristocratic planters with many slaves
developed the culture of rice, indigo, and cotton and helped to lay the
foundation of an agrarian economy in the South, a factor which was
to play a leading role in the controversies which divided the Nation in
the 19th century and led to civil war.</p>

<p class='c004'>Past Cockspur Island, then called “The Peeper,” in February 1733
sailed the pioneer band of English settlers under Gen. James Edward
Oglethorpe. At Yamacraw Bluff, 20 miles up the river, they established
Savannah, the small settlement which was the beginning of Georgia,
the 13th American colony. To Cockspur Island, John Wesley, founder
of Methodism, made a momentous visit 3 years later. Here, his journal
records, he “... first set ... foot on American ground.” More important
in the history of religion, Wesley, during this sojourn at
Cockspur, engaged in serious theological discussions which seem to
have implanted in his mind the basic idea of Methodism.</p>

</div>

<p class='c003'>A few years later Colonial leaders, fearing an attack by their perennial
enemies at Spanish St. Augustine, advocated the construction of
a fort on Cockspur Island to protect the growing port of Savannah.
As a result Fort George, a palisaded log blockhouse, was begun in 1761
under the supervision of His Majesty’s Surveyor-General John Gerar
William de Brahm. This pioneer fort on Cockspur Point provided a
measure of defense for the Savannah harbor, but principally enforced
quarantine and customs regulations, until the revolutionary activities
of 1776 when it was dismantled and abandoned by the Patriots, who
knew the fortification could not stand against a strong fleet.</p>

<p class='c004'>Soon after Fort George was abandoned, two British warships, accompanied
by a transport, arrived in Tybee Roads bent on securing fresh
provisions and information regarding the uprising in Georgia. Under
their formidable guns Cockspur Island served as a haven for Loyalists
fleeing from Savannah. Among the refugees was the Royal Governor,
Sir James Wright, who escaped to the island on the night of February
11, 1776. As he carried with him the great seal of the Province, Cockspur
Island became briefly the capital of colonial Georgia. In March,
the British ships boldly sailed up the river to Savannah where they
engaged the Patriots in a brief clash of arms and made off with several
ships laden with rice. With these events the story of Cockspur Island
in the Revolution was virtually at an end. When the British returned in
force to reoccupy Savannah in December 1778, the great fleet rendezvoused
at the anchorage off Cockspur Point, but the island lay deserted
and undisturbed.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='3' id='Page_3'></span>After the United States was established as a nation, new defenses
were needed to safeguard the young republic, and, in accord with
President Washington’s national defense policy, a second fort was built
in 1794-95, on Cockspur Island. Named Fort Greene in honor of the
Revolutionary hero, Gen. Nathanael Greene, who after the war made
his home at Mulberry Grove Plantation near Savannah, this fortification
consisted of a battery designed for six guns, and was constructed
of timbers and earth enclosed behind pickets. There was also a
guardhouse for the garrison.</p>

<p class='c004'>The history of Fort Greene was brief and tragic. Nine years after
the fort was built, it was totally destroyed and a part of the garrison
was drowned in the great hurricane that swept Cockspur in September
1804. Huge sea waves raked the island from end to end until not a
vestige of the fort remained. A quarter of a century was then to elapse
before Cockspur Island was again to be selected as the site of a
fortification to command the Savannah River.</p>

</div>

<p class='c003'>The United States can be proud of her victories in the War of 1812,
but there were also defeats. It was fortunate that while England was
fighting on this side of the Atlantic, her principal forces were engaged
in a death struggle with Napoleon on the continent of Europe. American
defenses were deplorably weak. On thousands of miles of coastline
there was scarcely a fort to oppose the enemy. British troops pillaged
and burned the city of Washington and laid waste to many sections
along the Middle Atlantic States. This humiliating and tragic lesson
soon aroused public opinion to demand strong measures for protection.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>After the Treaty of Ghent in 1814, which terminated the war with
Britain, President James Madison urged Congress to appropriate funds
to complete all forts then under construction and to extend the system
of fortifications in order that the United States might at all times be
prepared to prevent or repel the danger of foreign invasion.</p>

<p class='c004'>The task of developing entirely new and adequate fortifications
along the far-flung Atlantic and Gulf coasts was one which required
the direction of a military expert with special engineering abilities.
The Government’s search for a person peculiarly fitted for this position
resulted in securing the services of the distinguished French fortification
and military engineer, Gen. Simon Bernard, who was then seeking
employment in the United States.</p>

<p class='c004'>A graduate of the École Polytechnique in Paris, Bernard had served
with distinction in many of the campaigns of Napoleon. He displayed
such outstanding abilities in fortification and engineering tactics that
he soon acquired an enviable reputation. In 1815, after the Battle of
Waterloo, he came to the United States at the suggestion of Joseph
Bonaparte, bearing high recommendations to government officials
from Lafayette and Albert Gallatin. With the consent of Congress,
which had authorized the employment of a “skillful assistant,” President
Madison commissioned Bernard in the Corps of Engineers with
the rank of brigadier general by brevet. Early in December 1816, by
direct order of the President, General Bernard, Col. William McRee,
and Col. Joseph G. Totten formed a new “Board of Engineers,” the
duties of which were to devise a system of seacoast defense for the entire
country.</p>

<p class='c004'>President Monroe, who succeeded Madison, was even more energetic
than his predecessor in promoting the construction of new defenses.
During his administration fortification policies were established, surveys
were completed, and funds were provided to start construction.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>Cockspur Island was chosen as the site for a new fort in March 1821,
when the river approaches to Savannah were surveyed by Capt. John
Le Conte under the personal supervision of Bernard, but construction
on Cockspur was not begun until 1829. Plans approved by Bernard
in 1827 proved to be unsuitable and a revised plan was prepared in
1831. The fort, as originally designed, was a massive 2-story structure
mounting 3 tiers of guns. The deep mud of Cockspur, however,
offered no foundation for so great a weight. In revising the plans, it
was necessary to reduce the height of the walls and to provide heavy
wooden piles and grillage to support the brick masonry.</p>

<p class='c004'>Maj. Samuel Babcock, of the Corps of Engineers, was placed in
charge of construction in December 1828, and work got under way
early in the following year. Difficulty was encountered almost immediately
in establishing title to the island, ownership of which was
divided between private interests and the State of Georgia. In colonial
days, from 4 to 20 acres on Cockspur Point had been reserved by the
Crown for public use, and after the Revolution title to the Crown land
became vested in the State. The two earlier forts, George and Greene,
had been erected within this special reserve. The western portion of
Cockspur, embracing approximately 150 acres, was granted in 1759
by George II to Jonathan Bryan, Esq., from whom it passed, through
several hands, to the heirs of Edward Telfair, Governor of Georgia.
On March 15, 1830, the Telfair interests were purchased by the United
States for $5,000, and 15 years later the State of Georgia ceded the
public lands on Cockspur Point to the Federal Government.</p>

<p class='c004'>Late in 1829, Robert E. Lee, newly graduated from the United States
Military Academy at West Point, was appointed to duty under Babcock.
It was his first military assignment. Young Lee had the title of
<span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span>“acting assistant commissary of subsistence,” but, because of his
superior officer’s ill health, he actually ran the job for more than a
year until Babcock was succeeded by Lt. Joseph K. F. Mansfield. Lee
began the system of drainage and dikes for the island. He made
numerous surveys and located the permanent site for the fort. To
Mansfield, however, who served on Cockspur from 1831 to 1845,
belongs chief credit for construction. His great engineering ability,
combined with a passionate devotion to duty, enabled him to overcome
almost insurmountable difficulties to complete the fort.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>In 1833, the new fort was named Pulaski in honor of the Polish
hero, Count Casimir Pulaski, who fought in the American Revolution
and was mortally wounded at the Battle of Savannah on October 9,
1779. While rallying French and American forces in an attack on a
strong British redoubt, Pulaski was struck in the thigh by a grape
shot. He died 2 days later, and, according to tradition, was buried
at sea near the mouth of the Savannah River.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Work progressed at Fort Pulaski more or less continuously from
1829 to 1847, the year in which construction was essentially completed.
It was an enormous project. Bricks were bought in lots of from 1
to 7 million, and it is probable that as many as 25,000,000 were put into
the structure. Lumber, lime, lead, iron, and many other supplies were
bought in proportionately large quantities. The rose-brown bricks, of
which the walls are largely built, were manufactured at the old
Hermitage Plantation 2 miles west of Savannah. The much harder,
rose-red bricks in the embrasures, arches, and the walls facing the
parade ground were purchased in Baltimore, Md., and Alexandria, Va.
The granite was quarried in New York State and the brown sandstone
in the valley of the Connecticut River. Negro slaves, rented from the
owners of neighboring rice plantations, performed many of the hard
labor jobs, while skilled masons and carpenters were recruited not
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>only in Savannah but were also brought down each fall from Northern
States.</p>

</div>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span>Throughout the long years of Mansfield’s service on Cockspur Island
there were many frustrating delays. There were summers in which all
work had to stop because of the danger from malaria, yellow fever,
typhoid, and dysentery. There were periods when Congress failed to
appropriate funds. At least once, Mansfield continued to build on
credit—a bold expedient, which no Government servant today would
dare to follow. There were also destructive hurricanes and bone-chilling
winter gales. By the end of his tour of duty Mansfield was
thoroughly discouraged, but through his determined perseverance he
has left an enduring monument.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>Nearly a million dollars had been spent on Fort Pulaski by the end
of 1860, but in one respect it was not yet finished. Its armament was to
include 146 guns, but only 20 guns had been mounted. Nor had the
fort yet been garrisoned. At the end of 1860, its entire complement
included a caretaker and an ordnance sergeant. For three decades,
however, the project on Cockspur Island had served as a training
ground for the Corps of Engineers, and with the exception of Major
Babcock, who died in 1831, every engineer officer employed on the
construction of the fort finally achieved the distinction of becoming a
general in either the Confederate or the Union armies.</p>

</div>

<p class='c003'>When Abraham Lincoln won the national presidential election on
November 6, 1860, relations between North and South, already
dangerously strained, reached the breaking point. Lincoln, candidate
of the Republican Party, was supported also by a radical element in
the North and West that was demanding the abolition of slavery.
Reaction in the South to the result of the election was immediate.
Southern secessionists stirred the people of their section with fiery
speeches and sought to withdraw their States from the Union.
Southern conservatives tried to find a way out of political chaos by
compromise, but their task was hopeless. A whole generation had
failed to discover a successful plan by which the two sections of the
country could live at peace. The struggle had now gone beyond the
bounds of a political campaign; two divergent cultures stood face to
face on the threshold of war.</p>

<p class='c004'>With remarkable clarity of vision Gov. Joseph E. Brown of Georgia
began to put his State in a condition of defense many months in
advance of hostilities. The State volunteer military forces were reorganized
and strengthened, and many new volunteer companies were
formed. On his recommendation the legislature appropriated a million
dollars for State defense, authorized the acceptance of 10,000 troops,
and provided for a convention on January 16, 1861, to determine the
future course of Georgia.</p>

<p class='c004'>Meanwhile, Governor Brown continued to rush preparations for
defense. He obtained from the War Department sample sets of U. S.
Army infantry and cavalry equipment, which he proposed to manufacture
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>in Georgia. The Secretary of War also described, on request,
the type of rifled cannons and projectiles which the War Department
had found superior. Orders for cannon and arms were placed in
Northern States, and a bonus of $10,000 was offered by the State to
anyone setting up a cannon factory in Georgia which could make
3 guns a week and could cast a 10-inch columbiad.</p>

<p><b><i>Georgia troops on parade before the Pulaski Monument in Savannah.</i></b> <i>Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Weekly, 1861.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>In the midst of these preparations came the announcement that
South Carolina had seceded from the Union on December 20. The
news of this action was received in Georgia with demonstrations of
wild excitement. In Savannah, people wearing secession cockades
made of palmetto leaves erected a platform in one of the principal
squares on which they placed a large picture of a rattlesnake with the
inscription, “Don’t Tread on Me.” On the evening of December 26,
companies of militia and citizens marched with torch lights and transparencies
through the streets of Savannah in honor of South Carolina,
and houses all over the community were brilliantly illuminated.</p>

<p class='c004'>Simultaneously an event was taking place in Charleston, S. C., that
was to have an almost immediate effect on the course of action in
Georgia, and, in fact, on the destiny of the entire South.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>On that same evening, Maj. Robert Anderson, in command of the
United States troops stationed in Charleston Harbor, moved his small
garrison from an insecure position at Fort Moultrie on Sullivan’s
Island, to Fort Sumter, a strong fortification in the middle of the
harbor. This unexpected move enraged not only the people of Charleston,
but of all the slave-holding States. President James Buchanan, it
was understood, had assured the Government of South Carolina that
no change in the status of the United States forces at Charleston would
be made until the difficulties between the State and Federal Governments
had been settled. Major Anderson, however, fearing that an
attack was imminent, evacuated Fort Moultrie with great secrecy,
spiked the cannons and burned most of the gun carriages.</p>

<p class='c004'>The news of the occupation of Fort Sumter, which reached Savannah
by telegraph early Thursday morning, December 27, stunned
the people, it is said, like “an electric shock.” Groups of angry citizens
gathered on the streets to discuss the news and to give vent to their
feelings. “There is but one sentiment on the question,” announced the
Savannah <i>Republican</i>, “and that is of indignation and resistance....
We might have been quieted by a milder course, but there are none
of us so degraded as to submit to being whipped into submission.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Federal forces in possession of Fort Sumter had Charleston Harbor
blocked. The same danger, it was argued at a meeting of civil and
military leaders, threatened the Georgia seaport, for, if it was the
policy of the United States to provoke a war, the Federal Government,
in furtherance of that policy, would occupy and hold all forts commanding
the harbors of the Southern States. For their own safety,
therefore, the people of Savannah determined to seize Fort Pulaski
before the Federal Government had time to send a garrison to defend it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Military men in Savannah realized the gravity of taking so serious
a step toward revolution as, no doubt, did thoughtful civilians, but
the popular spirit of the mob had been stirred to the point of spontaneous
action. On the night of December 31, the Savannah <i>Republican</i>
received a copy of an ominous telegram to Alexander H. Stephens
from United States Senator Robert Toombs, of Georgia. In this telegram
Toombs warned the State of Georgia that a policy of coercion
had been adopted by the Administration, that Joseph Holt, a bitter
foe of the South, had been made Secretary of War, that the abolitionists
were defiant, and that, in consequence, Fort Pulaski was in danger.
The time had come for action.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<div class='ic015'>
<p><b><i>Gov. Joseph E. Brown, who ordered the seizure of Fort Pulaski.</i></b> From Avery’s <i>History of Georgia</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Early next morning, Col. Alexander R. Lawton, in command of the
1st Volunteer Regiment of Georgia, telegraphed Governor Brown
requesting him to come to Savannah at once. The Governor arrived
about 9 p. m., and, after several meetings with leading citizens and
military men, ordered the State militia to seize Fort Pulaski.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>As there were no Federal troops garrisoned at Fort Pulaski, no
difficulty was anticipated in seizing it, but the task of preparing an
expedition in 24 hours for the purpose of occupying the stronghold
was not a small matter. Arms, ammunition, and equipment had to
be provided, commissary supplies purchased, and a steamboat for the
transportation of men and baggage to Cockspur Island had to be
secured. Detachments of 50 men each from the Savannah Volunteer
Guards and the Oglethorpe Light Infantry and 34 men from the
Chatham Artillery were selected to make the expedition. Each man
was instructed to carry with him a knapsack containing a change of
clothing, iron spoon, knife, fork, tin cup, clothesbrush, shoebrush,
box of blacking, and a comb and brush.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Early next morning, January 3, 1861, the troops assembled in a
pouring rain and marched through streets lined with cheering citizens
to the wharf at the foot of West Broad Street, where they embarked
on the U. S. Government sidewheel steamboat, <i>Ida</i>, for the
journey down the river. In personal command was Colonel Lawton.
This small expeditionary force is said to have carried enough baggage
to have served a division later in the war. Every soldier had a trunk,
a cot, and a roll of bedding, while to every 3 or 4 men there was a huge
mess chest large enough for the cooking outfit of a full regiment.
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>Aboard also was the battery of the Chatham Artillery, which consisted
of two 12-pounder howitzers and four 6-pounder field guns,
all bronze.</p>

<div class='ic017'>
<p><i><b>U. S. Government sidewheel steamboat, Ida</b></i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>At noon, the Savannah troops reached Cockspur Island and marched
into Fort Pulaski with drums beating and colors flying. Colonel Lawton
took formal possession of the fortification and the flag of Georgia was
raised above the ramparts and saluted. No resistance was encountered.
As the troops marched out on the parade ground of the fort, clouds
which had obscured the sky for nearly a week broke away and the sun
shone brightly. This was taken as a good omen. Georgia was now in
possession of the strong fortification at the mouth of the Savannah
River. The Governor’s orders were to hold it against all persons and to
abandon it only under new orders from him or under compulsion by an
overpowering hostile force.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='georgia' class='c009'><span class='xlarge'><i>Under the Georgia Flag</i></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Fort Pulaski was in no condition for defense on January 3 nor for
many weeks thereafter. Had the Federal Government taken immediate
and effective action, the incident on Cockspur Island might
have ended quickly in complete fiasco. When Capt. Francis S. Bartow
of the Oglethorpe Light Infantry took command of the post there was
not a single serviceable gun in the fort. The moat was filled with mud
and overgrown with marsh grass. Furthermore, the military experience
of the members of his garrison had been limited to armory drill
and dress parade.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>During the first weeks after the seizure there was feverish activity
to put the fort in condition required to withstand attack. Twenty
32-pounder naval guns, which had been mounted in 1840, were remounted
in the casemates and on the ramparts. More than 100 rice-field
slaves were engaged to dig the mud from the moat, and daily
boat service was established between Savannah and Cockspur Island.</p>

<p class='c004'>For a few days the garrison was in a state of great confusion.
Baggage, which had preceded the troops, was hopelessly mixed up.
Some squads with food had no pots to cook it in, while other squads
with an abundance of pots and pans had no knives or forks with which
to eat. Strict discipline, however, soon brought order out of chaos.
All day the men were kept busy. They drilled in the manual of arms
and learned to handle artillery. They sorted and redistributed equipment,
filled mattress covers with hay, made cartridge bags, and stowed
their ammunition in the magazines. Spirits were high and the men
worked with a will.</p>

<p class='c004'>As additional guns were secured they were mounted and others
were ordered from the Tredegar Iron Works in Richmond. A telegraph
line was erected between Savannah and Cockspur Island.
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>Earthworks were constructed and manned on Hilton Head Island,
in South Carolina, Tybee Island, and other islands southward along
the Georgia coast. Fort Jackson, 5 miles below Savannah, was placed
in order and work was begun on an interior line of defenses from
Red Bluff on the north bank of the Savannah River delta to Genesis
Point on the south bank of the Great Ogeechee.</p>

<p class='c004'>The land defenses were supplemented by a small fleet of river boats
on which guns had been mounted. This motley collection of side-wheelers,
known as the Georgia Navy, was under the command of
Commodore Josiah Tattnall, famous old naval officer, who years before
had brought United States ships to the rescue of the British in
China waters with the battle cry “Blood is thicker than water.”</p>

<p class='c004'>In the late spring of 1861, the defenses of Savannah were not yet
perfect but they were rapidly gaining in strength. In company with
Commodore Tattnall and General Lawton, William Howard Russell,
correspondent of the <i>London Times</i>, inspected these defenses on May 1.</p>

<p class='c004'>At Cockspur Island, Russell found a guard on duty at the landing,
“tall, stout young fellows in various uniforms or in rude mufti, in
which the Garibaldian red shirt and felt slouched hats predominated.
They were armed with smoothbore muskets (date 1851), quite new;
and their bayonets, barrels and locks were quite bright and clean. The
officer on duty was dressed in blue frock coat with brass buttons
emblazoned with the arms of the State, a red silk sash, and glazed kepi,
and straw colored gauntlets.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Russell was impressed by the strength and solidity of the fort and
by the preparations being made for its defense. He found its garrison of
650 men hard at work. Tents were pitched in the demilune and on the
terreplein, and the parade ground presented a scene of life and animation.
Men were building sandbag traverses to guard the magazine
doors. Other were rolling away stores and casks of ammunition and
provisions, while still others were mounting 10-inch columbiads on the
ramparts.</p>

<p class='c004'>Notwithstanding the praise he gave to Fort Pulaski at the conclusion
of his tour, Correspondent Russell was not convinced that Savannah
was safe from invasion. He pointed out to General Lawton the weaknesses
of the fort. The lowland, he said, made it accessible to boats, and
it was open to approach from the rear.</p>

<p class='c004'>“True enough,” Lawton agreed, but added boastfully, “the Commodore
will take care of the Yankees at sea and we shall manage them
on land!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Tattnall smiled. “I have no fleet,” he said, “and long before the
Southern Confederacy has a fleet that can cope with the Stars and
Stripes, my bones will be white in the grave.”</p>

<p class='c004'>That night Russell recorded in his diary: “These people all make a
mistake in referring to the events of the old war. ‘We beat off the British
fleet at Charleston by the militia—ergo, we’ll sink the Yankees now.’
They do not understand the nature of the new shells and heavy vertical
fire, or the effect of projectiles from great distances falling into
works.... We got back by eight o’clock p. m. after a pleasant day.
What I saw did not satisfy me that Pulaski was strong, or Savannah
very safe.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>On April 9, a private in Company D, 1st Regiment of Georgia,
wrote to his mother, “We look for a fight every day. We are well
prepared, and the boys are in good spirits ‘Spilin’ for a fight.”</p>

<p class='c004'>People in the South who were spoiling for a fight did not have long
to wait. In Charleston Harbor, at 4:30 on the morning of April 12,
1861, a Confederate mortar at Fort Johnson fired a shell which arched
across the sky and burst almost directly over Fort Sumter. With this
shot, the tragedy of civil war began.</p>

<p class='c004'>On May 21, Francis S. Bartow, who had opposed the seizure of Fort
Pulaski and yet had served as its first commanding officer under the
Georgia flag, led the Oglethorpe Light Infantry to the railroad station
to entrain for Virginia. The streets were lined with cheering citizens;
the band played “Bold Soldier Boy.” Two months later, in a gallant
charge on the Federal batteries at Manassas, Bartow, now a brigadier,
was shot through the heart.</p>

</div>

<p class='c003'>By midsummer, 1861, the North had already planned the strategy that
led to the fall of Fort Pulaski. This plan included a naval blockade of
the South and the recapture of the southern seacoast fortifications.
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>On October 29, a combined Army and Navy expedition sailed under
sealed orders from Hampton Roads. The great convoy, composed of
51 vessels, moved out to sea in 3 columns—an impressive sight that
foreshadowed the amphibious movements of World War II. Twenty-five
colliers under gunboat escort had sailed the day before. Army
forces numbering more than 12,500 men were under the command of
Brig. Gen. Thomas W. Sherman, while the naval squadron and the
convoy were commanded by Capt. Samuel F. Du Pont.</p>

<p class='c004'>At destination, the invading troops were to land in three waves by
means of surf boats capable of carrying from 70 to 100 men each.
These boats were to approach the beach abreast in line of battle. Infantry,
light artillery, and engineers with entrenching tools and sandbags
were to go in on the first wave and were expected to overcome initial
enemy resistance and dig in on the beach. Heavy field artillery would
move in on the second wave and reserves on the third. As soon as the
landing had been effected, all boats were to report to the chief quartermaster
for unloading supplies.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>This plan of battle was never executed, for a few days after sailing
the expedition ran into a terrific storm off Cape Hatteras. Several
vessels and many of the landing craft were lost. Thus handicapped,
General Sherman might have had grave difficulty in securing the
beachhead. When the convoy finally reassembled off Port Royal Sound,
S. C., the Navy took the initiative. On November 7, Flag Officer
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>Du Pont led his squadron of steam-propelled vessels to the entrance of
the sound where he formed a great oval between the two Confederate
forts on Hilton Head and Bay Point. Steaming continuously each vessel
fired a broadside as it came opposite one of the forts. So punishing was
the effect of this naval bombardment that the Confederates abandoned
both fortifications, and the landings on Hilton Head and Bay Point
were unopposed. A few days after this initial battle, the town of Port
Royal on the mainland fell to the expeditionary force. From these
vantage points within sight of Cockspur Island, the Federal troops
were made ready to strike at Fort Pulaski.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='generallee' class='c009'><span class='xlarge'><i>General Lee Returns to Fort Pulaski</i></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The fall of the forts at Hilton Head and Bay Point and the complete
rout of the Confederate forces defending them brought panic to
Savannah and the adjacent countryside. It was assumed that the
Georgia seaport was the real objective of the Federal expedition, and
many people, who could afford it, fled to towns and cities in the
interior of the State.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>At this critical moment Robert E. Lee arrived in Savannah to take
charge of the defense. Lee, who had resigned his commission in
the United States Army when Virginia seceded from the Union,
was now a brigadier general under Confederate colors and had been
given command of the forces in South Carolina, Georgia, and east
Florida.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Battle of Port Royal Sound demonstrated to Lee that without
adequate naval support it would be impossible to defend the small
batteries and forts on the seacoast islands which were all within range
of the powerful guns of the Federal fleet. Nor would it be possible to
prevent enemy landings on these beach islands without immobilizing
thousands of troops for garrison duty, troops that were badly needed
in other theaters of war. Even if the manpower could have been
spared for island defense, the logistical difficulties of arming and
supplying isolated and remote outposts were beyond the capacities
of the State or Confederate Governments.</p>

<p class='c004'>With these considerations in mind, Lee ordered the abandonment
of the sea islands of Georgia, the removal of the guns from the batteries,
and the withdrawal of the troops to the inner line of defenses
on the mainland. This strategy was later confirmed and made the
policy of the Confederate Department of War.</p>

<p class='c004'>On November 10, Tybee Island was abandoned. All batteries were
leveled and the heavy guns were ferried across the South Channel to
Fort Pulaski. Two companies of infantry from the Tybee garrison
were added to the complement at the fort and the remaining troops
were withdrawn to Savannah. This was a fateful move for it directly
affected the destiny of Fort Pulaski.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the time, however, no new danger to the fortification on
Cockspur Island was anticipated through the abandonment of Tybee
Island. It was expected that the fort could defend itself successfully
against a naval attack and it was also considered safe from land bombardment.
To keep open a line of communications and supply, all side
channels leading into the Savannah River above the fort were barred
by obstructions. These obstructions, in turn, were protected by floating
mines activated by galvanic batteries. The mines, or “infernal machines”
as they were called in the naval report, were a new invention
which the Confederates borrowed from the Russians. The responsibility
for denying the Federal gunboats an opportunity to force a
passage through the obstructed side channels into the Savannah River
was assigned to Tattnall’s flotilla.</p>

<p class='c004'>In theory, at least, it should have been possible to hold out at Fort
Pulaski indefinitely. When the supply line was finally cut, it was not
due to any failure in the plan for the protection of the river, but rather
to a lack of vigilance on the part of the Georgia Navy, which permitted
the Federals to construct strong batteries in the marshes on
the north and south banks of the Savannah between the fort and the
city.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>Twice during November, General Lee inspected the fort on Cockspur
Island and gave minute instructions regarding the manner in
which it was to be defended. He foresaw the danger of attack from the
rear and ordered certain guns to be mounted on the ramparts above the
gorge.</p>

<p class='c004'>Fort Pulaski celebrated Christmas, 1861, in a big way. The men of
the garrison felt snug and secure. In the messes, the tables groaned
under the weight of delicacies sent down by friends in Savannah.
Eggnog parties were held in many of the casemates. Pvt. John Hart
of the Irish Jasper Greens wrote exuberantly in his diary: “Fine day
here. Plenty of fighting and whisky drinking.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Ten miles away, in the Federal camp on Hilton Head Island,
Christmas was not quite so pleasant. The men were kept hard at work
digging entrenchments and unloading captured cotton from a steamboat.
When the troops were finally released to enjoy themselves, they
had to find their own entertainment. Pvt. Charles Lafferty, of the
48th Regiment of New York Volunteers, wrote his sister: “We had
a merry Christmas down hear. We bought sassiges of the nigers and
hoe cake and build a fir and cooked our sassiages. That is the way
we spent our Christmas.”</p>

  <h2 id='investment' class='c009'><span class='xlarge'><i>Investment of Fort Pulaski</i></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>In the summer of 1861, President Lincoln proclaimed a naval blockade
of the South, but it was not until after the Battle of Port Royal
Sound, when Flag Officer Du Pont took direct command, that the
Union patrols on the Carolina and Georgia coasts became effective. The
British Steamer <i>Fingal</i>, with munitions, ordnance, and other supplies,
got through to Savannah on November 13 and had the distinction
of being the last ship to run the blockade into that port.
Pulaski’s share of the cargo was two 24-pounder Blakely rifles and a
large number of Enfields. Early in December, Du Pont tightened the
stranglehold he already had on the commerce of Savannah by sinking
vessels loaded with stone across the channel of the river, and by
placing gunboats in Ossabaw and Warsaw Sounds to prevent entrance
or escape through these back doors to the port.</p>

<p class='c004'>After setting up headquarters on Hilton Head Island on the north
shore of Tybee Roads, General Sherman kept his men busy repairing
and strengthening the fortifications on Port Royal Sound. He constructed
an extensive base for operations and established a hospital.
On December 4 he requisitioned siege guns for the proposed attack
on Fort Pulaski and not long after he landed a permanent garrison on
Tybee Island.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<div class='ic021'>
<p><b><i>Occupation of Tybee Island by Federal troops brings panic to Savannah.</i></b> Contemporary sketch from <i>The Soldier in Our Civil War</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>While engaged in these activities Sherman conceived the idea that
it might be more advantageous to by-pass Fort Pulaski and make a
direct attack on the city of Savannah. He tried to sell this plan to the
commander of the naval forces on whom he would have to depend
for transport, protection, and assistance in the siege operations he
had in mind. Du Pont obligingly ordered a reconnaissance of the
winding waterways that led into the Savannah River above Fort
Pulaski, but when he discovered how shallow these waterways were
at certain stages of the tide, he pronounced the whole scheme impractical
and dangerous. This difference of opinion between the
Army and Navy commanders on the conduct of the campaign finally
led to the removal of Sherman, but in the meantime the general
ordered a tight noose of batteries and gunboats to be thrown around
Fort Pulaski.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the Confederate supply ship, <i>Ida</i>, came down the Savannah
River on the morning of February 13 on one of her regular trips to
the fort, a battery of heavy guns, which the Federals had secretly
constructed at Venus Point on the north bank of the river, opened up.
The old sidewheeler ran the gauntlet under full steam with shots
splashing in her wake. Luck was with her, for the Federal guns, after
firing nine shots, recoiled off their platforms. It was the <i>Ida’s</i> last
trip to Pulaski. Two days later she slipped her moorings, ran down
the South Channel under the guns of the fort, rounded the point at
Lazaretto, and returned to Savannah through Tybee Creek and the
Wilmington Narrows.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>During the following week the Federals completed the absolute
investment or blockade of Fort Pulaski. They built another strong
battery on the south bank of the Savannah River opposite Venus Point
and threw a boom across Tybee Creek. To seal this waterway they
entrenched two companies of infantry along its bank and assigned a
gunboat to patrol the channel. At the same time they destroyed the
telegraph line between Savannah and Cockspur Island. From now on
neither supplies nor reinforcements could be brought to the fort, nor
could the Confederate garrison escape to the mainland. After February
15 the only communication with Savannah was by courier who
came and went by night through the marshes, often having to swim
the creeks and rivers to avoid the Federal pickets.</p>

<p class='c004'>Five companies formed the garrison of Fort Pulaski when the fort
was cut off. Company B of the Oglethorpe Light Infantry, the German
Volunteers, the Washington Volunteers, and the Montgomery Guards
were members of the 1st Regiment of Georgia Volunteers. The Macon
Wise Guards was accredited to the 25th Regiment of Georgia
Regulars. The total strength of the garrison was 385 officers and men.
In command was Charles H. Olmstead, who had been elected colonel
of the 1st Volunteer Regiment on December 26. To defend the fort
there were 48 guns.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The armament was distributed evenly to command all approaches.
On the ramparts facing Tybee Island were five 8-inch and four 10-inch
columbiads, one 24-pounder Blakely rifle, and two 10-inch seacoast
mortars. In the casemates bearing on Tybee were one 8-inch columbiad
and four 32-pounder guns, while in batteries outside the fort were two
12-inch and one 10-inch seacoast mortars. The remaining guns were
mounted to command the North Channel of the Savannah River and
the sweeping marshes to the west.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='weapon' class='c009'><span class='xlarge'><i>The New Weapon</i></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The time had come to decide whether to take Fort Pulaski by force
or to wait for the garrison to starve. The fort had been provisioned on
January 28 with a 6 months’ supply of food, which might have been
made to last, by careful rationing, to mid-August or even September.
Eventually, however, surrender would have been inevitable. Sherman
was undoubtedly aware of these circumstances, but he does not seem
to have given serious thought to playing a waiting game. The Northern
press was clamoring for action, and Sherman, himself, was still bent
on the quick capture of Savannah. Whatever merit this dream may
have had will never be known, for on February 14 the Commanding
General of the United States Army ordered the entire effort of the
expeditionary force to be expended on the reduction of Fort Pulaski.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>Long before this order reached headquarters on Hilton Head Island,
Sherman had taken decisive action. On February 19 he sent his Chief
Engineer, Capt. Quincy A. Gillmore, to take command of all troops on
Tybee Island and to prepare for the bombardment of Fort Pulaski.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>Gillmore was destined to play the leading role in the Fort Pulaski
story and win for the fort a permanent niche in the military annals
of the United States. A brilliant member of the Corps of Engineers,
he is described by the newspaper correspondent, Whitelaw Reid, as
“a quick-speaking, quick-moving, soldierly man ... a fine, wholesome
looking, solid six footer, with big head, broad, good humored
face, and a high forehead faintly elongated by a suspicion of baldness,
curly brown hair and beard, and a frank open face.” His greatest
attribute as a soldier was a fearless disregard for tradition. At the
Battle of Fort Pulaski, Gillmore was breveted a brigadier and later he
became a major general of volunteers.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>In 1862, Fort Pulaski was considered invincible. Its 7½-foot solid
brick walls were backed with massive piers of masonry. The broad
waters of the Savannah River and wide swampy marshes surrounded
the fort on all sides. Ships of the Navy could not safely come within
effective range of this citadel, and there was no firm ground on which
land batteries could be erected nearer than Tybee Island, from 1 to 2½
miles away. All previous military experience had taught that beyond a
distance of 700 yards smoothbore guns and mortars would have little
chance to break through heavy masonry walls, and beyond 1,000 yards
no chance at all.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>In referring to Fort Pulaski, the United States Chief of Engineers,
General Totten, said “you might as well bombard the Rocky Mountains.”
General Lee, himself, standing on the parapet of the fort with
Colonel Olmstead, pointed to the shore of Tybee Island and remarked,
“Colonel, they will make it pretty warm for you here with shells, but
they cannot breach your walls at that distance.” In the minds of the
experts a long-range bombardment would merely serve to pave the
way for a direct assault.</p>

<div class='ic024'>
<p><b><i>Air view of Fort Pulaski.</i></b></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Gillmore held a different opinion. He was familiar with the test
records of a new weapon, the rifled gun, with which the Army had
begun to experiment in 1859, and, on December 1, 1861, he broke with
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>tradition and risked the laughter of his superiors. After a careful
reconnaissance he reported to Sherman that it would be possible to
reduce Fort Pulaski with mortars and rifled guns from Tybee Island.
On this basis he submitted a complete plan for the attack on Fort
Pulaski. Sherman approved the plan, but he made it clear that he
doubted the usefulness of the rifled guns. In concluding his endorsement
he wrote, “All that can be done with guns is to shake the walls
in a random manner.”</p>

  <h2 id='gillmore' class='c009'><span class='xlarge'><i>Gillmore Sets the Stage</i></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>From the 21st of February, when ordnance and ordnance stores began
to arrive in Tybee Roads, until April 9th, Gillmore gave the men of
his command no rest. To put his plan for the siege into effect was a
Herculean task. Materials, supplies, ammunition, and guns had to be
unloaded through the surf and then transported long distances across
sand and marsh. Gun emplacements, magazines, bomb-proof shelters,
and roads had to be constructed. And last, but not least, gun crews
had to be trained.</p>

<p class='c004'>Detailed to this back-breaking assignment were the 7th Regiment
Connecticut Volunteers, the 46th New York Volunteers, two companies
of the Volunteer Engineers, and, for most of the time, two
companies of the 3rd Rhode Island Volunteer Artillery.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the northwest shore of Tybee Island facing Fort Pulaski these
troops erected 11 batteries for guns and mortars. Their job was made
particularly difficult because the last mile of the shore, on which seven
of the major batteries had to be established, was an open marsh in
full view of the fort and within effective range of its guns. Here all
work was performed at night. The men were not allowed to speak
above a whisper and were guided by the notes of a whistle. Before
dawn each morning evidence of the night’s work was concealed by
camouflage.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>When the batteries were ready, the guns were hauled across the
marsh on sling carts. These loads were so extraordinarily heavy that
it was often necessary to harness 250 men to a cart. Even on the last
night before the bombardment the work continued. In the flickering
light of lanterns men filled cartridge bags, cut paper fuses, and whittled
wooden fuse plugs.</p>

</div>

<p class='c003'>On March 31, when preparations for the bombardment were almost
complete, General Sherman was relieved of his command, and responsibility
for the campaign in the Department of the South was turned
over to Maj. Gen. David Hunter. While this move undoubtedly led
to greater harmony of action between Army and Navy leaders,
Sherman deserves much of the credit for the successful operations
against Pulaski. Neither General Hunter nor Brig. Gen. Henry W. Benham,
whom he had placed in command of the Northern District of the
Department, suggested a single change in the siege works under construction
on Tybee, and Gillmore was retained to conduct the bombardment.
On the afternoon of April 9, everything was in readiness to open
fire. General orders were issued, the Navy alerted, and the battle set
for the following morning.</p>

<p class='c004'>On Cockspur Island, meanwhile, the Confederates were engaged
in making final arrangements to defend Fort Pulaski. The garrison
had worked long hours, and the men were weary and apprehensive.
In accord with the instructions of General Lee they tore down the
light veranda in front of the officers’ quarters and replaced it with a
traverse or covered passage made of timbers and earth. They piled
sandbags between the guns on the ramparts and dug “rat holes” in
the terreplein for the protection of the gunners. To prevent round
shot and shell from rolling, they cut the entire parade ground into
wide traps and trenches.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>In Savannah, on the eve of the battle for Pulaski, a large audience
unaware of the impending event, was entertained by Blind Tom,
famous Negro pianist, who played his original composition, “The
Battle of Manassas.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='bombardment' class='c009'><span class='xlarge'><i>Bombardment</i></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Morning on the 10th of April 1862, broke clear and cold. A fresh
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>easterly wind whipped the red waters of the Savannah River into
whitecaps, and the brown and purple marshes were showing the
green of early spring. Soon after sunrise, a lieutenant on duty on the
ramparts of Fort Pulaski reported that suspicious changes in the landscape
had been made during the night on Tybee Island near the mouth
of Tybee Creek. Several old chimneys had been torn down; the top
of the ridge had been leveled; brush and trees had been removed;
and there were dark objects visible that looked as though they might
be guns.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>While Olmstead and his officers discussed these ominous signs, they
saw a small boat put out from the shore of Tybee under a flag of
truce and head up the South Channel. Word spread quickly through
the fort and men swarmed up to the parapet to watch. Soon the small
boat landed at the south wharf. It brought Lt. J. H. Wilson, of the
Topographical Engineers, to Cockspur Island with a formal demand
to surrender.</p>

<p class='c004'>Colonel Olmstead retired to his quarters, where, after a brief time,
he composed his reply:</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir, I have to acknowledge receipt of your communication of this date,
demanding the unconditional surrender of Fort Pulaski.</p>

<p class='c013'>In reply I can only say, that I am here to defend the Fort, not to
surrender it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now that the time had come to fight, the men experienced a great
sense of relief. They joked and laughed among themselves as they
cleaned up the parade ground, carried ammunition to the guns, and
prepared for action.</p>

<p class='c004'>At 10 minutes past 8 o’clock a single 13-inch mortar shell rose from
Battery Halleck with a muffled roar. It traveled slowly in a high arc
over the fort and exploded in the air beyond. The second mortar shell,
from Battery Stanton, fell short, exploding in the marsh east of the
fort. And now the line of fire rolled along Tybee Beach, extending
itself to right and left as battery after battery unmasked mortars, guns,
and columbiads.</p>

<p class='c004'>For some minutes Pulaski was silent; then, four casemate guns were
fired in rapid succession. Almost immediately the guns on the barbette
joined in the action directing their fire toward the rifle batteries at
King’s Landing on Tybee Island.</p>

<p class='c004'>The first shots on both sides went wide of their marks as the gunners
attempted to box their targets. One of the barbette guns of the
fort recoiled completely off its chassis, while similar accidents on
Tybee put four 10-inch columbiads out of the fight. Despite these early
mishaps, the fire from each side was soon rapid and increasingly
accurate.</p>

<p class='c004'>Early in the day the men in the fort learned that they had little to
fear from the Federal mortars. Most of the 10-inch and 13-inch mortar
shells exploded high in the air or fell outside. The few that dropped
on the parade buried themselves in the ground and, on exploding,
threw up harmless geysers of mud. Whenever a ponderous solid shot
from a columbiad landed squarely on the wall, however, the whole
fort quivered and shook. About 2 hours after the fight began, one of
these solid shots entered an embrasure and dismounted the casemate
gun. Several members of the gun crew were wounded, one so severely
that it was necessary to amputate his arm immediately. At 11 o’clock
the halyards on the flag pole were cut by a fragment of shell and the
flag swooped down within the fort. Lt. Christopher Hussey of the
Montgomery Guards and Pvt. John Latham of the German Volunteers
sprang upon the parapet and carried the flag under fire to the northeast
angle where they raised it again on the ramrod of a cannon.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>At noon observers on Tybee counted 47 scars on the south flank,
pancoupe, and southeast face of the fort, and it was already obvious
that several of the embrasures were considerably enlarged. During the
afternoon the fire slackened on both sides, and after sunset not more
than 7 or 8 shells an hour were thrown until daylight the next morning.
At the end of the day to observers on Tybee, the fort, notwithstanding
its dents and scars, looked nearly as solid and capable of
resistance as when fire was opened in the morning. There was a
general feeling among the Union soldiers that the day’s work had
not greatly hastened the surrender. The mortars had proved a disappointment
and the effect of the breaching fire could not be definitely
determined. Although there had been many narrow escapes, no one
had been hurt in the Federal batteries.</p>

<p class='c004'>Had Gillmore been able to inspect the fort at the end of the first
day, he would have had reason to rejoice. The place was in shambles.
Nearly all of the barbette guns and mortars bearing upon Tybee had
been dismounted and only two of the five casemate guns were in
order. At the southeast angle, the whole wall from the crest of the
parapet to the moat was flaked away to a depth of from 2 to 4 feet.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='surrender' class='c009'><span class='xlarge'><i>Surrender</i></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>On Friday morning, at daylight, the bombardment reopened with
fresh vigor on both sides. Pulaski had repaired some of her guns during
the night and now directed her barbette fire with considerable precision
and rapidity. From Tybee, Gillmore’s gunners resumed the
work of breaching with determination, and the effect was almost immediately
apparent in the enlargement of the two embrasures on the
left of the southeast face of the fort. Pulaski’s fire was far less accurate
than that of the Federals. The batteries on Tybee were nearly all
masked behind a low sand ridge and were also protected by heavy
sandbag revetments. Most of the Confederate shot and shell buried
themselves in the beach or traveled completely over the Federal batteries
and trenches. About 9 o’clock the besiegers received their only
casualty. A solid shot from Pulaski entered a gun embrasure in Battery
McClellan striking a private soldier and wounded him so severely
that he died soon after.</p>

<p class='c004'>During the morning, the naval gunboat, <i>Norwich</i>, began to fire
against the northeast face of the fort, but the range was too great and
her shots struck only glancing blows on the brick walls. A battery on
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>Long Island opened up at long range from the west, and shots were
landing on the south wall from guns located on a barge in Tybee
Creek.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>At noon, a considerable part of the Federal fire was directed against
the guns on the ramparts of the fort and within half an hour these
guns were silenced. By now, two great holes had been opened through
the walls and the inside of the fort was visible from Tybee. The interior
arches had been laid bare, and a barbette gun on the parapet was
tottering, ready to fall. It was plain that the whole east angle would
soon be in ruins. General Benham gave orders to prepare to take
Fort Pulaski by direct assault.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the fort, when all men were ordered from the ramparts to allow
the guns to cool, Pvt. L. W. Landershine thought that “things looked
blue.” One man had been mortally wounded, another had had his
foot taken off by the recoil of a gun, and a dozen others had been
struck by fragments of shell. Projectiles from the rifle batteries were
passing completely through the breach, sweeping across the parade, and
striking against the walls of the north magazine in which 40,000
pounds of black powder was stored.</p>

<p class='c004'>The moment had come for Olmstead to make a decision. There
were only two courses open. He could fight on against overwhelming
odds, or he could admit defeat. It must have been a difficult choice
for the gallant 25-year-old colonel to make. Impressed by the utter
hopelessness of the situation and believing the lives of the garrison
to be his next care, he gave the order for surrender.</p>

<p class='c004'>Says Private Landershine, who was at this time discussing the state
of affairs with his comrades, “About 2-12 p. m. I seen Col. Olmstead
and Capt. Sims go past with a rammer and a sheet, we all knew that
it was over with us and we would have to give up.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>The Confederate flag was lowered half way and a final gun was
fired from a casemate. Then the flag was hauled down and the white
sheet took its place. An old era in coastal fortifications had come to an
end.</p>

<p class='c004'>On Tybee there was wild rejoicing. Men danced together on the
beach, shook hands, and cheered General Gillmore as he rode along
the line. At King’s Landing, Gillmore embarked on a small boat
with his aides. The passage up the South Channel was rough, the skiff
ran aground and was nearly swamped by the heavy seas. Soaked with
the salt tides of the Savannah, the party landed at Cockspur Island
and advanced toward the fort under a flag of truce. Colonel Olmstead
was waiting at the entrance. He showed the way to his quarters, and,
during an hour alone with General Gillmore, the terms of the
capitulation were settled. After inspecting the fort, the general took
leave.</p>

<p class='c004'>In Colonel Olmstead’s quarters by the half-light of candles, the
officers of the fort gave up their swords to General Hunter’s representative,
Maj. Charles G. Halpine. The weapons were laid on a table,
and each officer, according to his rank, advanced in turn, mentioned
his name and title, and spoke a few words appropriate to the occasion.
Said Colonel Olmstead, “I yield my sword, but I trust I have
not disgraced it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The men of the garrison were formed by companies on the parade,
stacked their arms, and marched to quarters for the night. The Stars
and Stripes was then raised over the ramparts, and Pulaski again
became part of the possessions, as well as the property, of the Union.</p>

<p class='c004'>Terms of the surrender were unconditional.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='siege' class='c009'><span class='xlarge'><i>Significance of the Siege</i></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>In its relation to the total strategy of the Civil War, the reduction
of Fort Pulaski was important. The blockade directed against the
South was materially strengthened by the acquisition of this fortress
in the mouth of the Savannah River. After the surrender, Northern
troops occupied the fort and commanded the entrance to the principal
port of Georgia. It thus served as one of the many pincers that throttled
the economic life of the South.</p>

<p class='c004'>When viewed in larger perspective, however, an even greater significance
may be attached to the battle for the once-great fort. “The
result of this bombardment,” General Hunter declared in his report
to the Secretary of War, “must cause a change in the construction of
fortifications as radical as that foreshadowed in naval architecture by
the conflict between the <i>Monitor</i> and <i>Merrimac</i>. No works of stone
or brick can resist the impact of rifled artillery of heavy calibre.” Subsequent
events verified this prophetic statement, and the Fort Pulaski
incident may be considered one of the many mileposts in history. The
strategy that had guided military experts had to be revised to meet the
threat of a new weapon of war, and Fort Pulaski, because of the
consequent changes, has become an interesting relic of another age.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>In the 2 days of battle, 5,275 shot and shell were fired against the
fort, but the breach through the walls was largely the result of three
guns—two 84-pounder and one 64-pounder James rifles. Solid projectiles
from these guns at a distance of 1,640 yards penetrated the
brickwork from 20 to 25 inches with shattering lateral effect. Shots
from the other rifles were erratic in flight—some wabbling, some
turning end-over-end—and did little damage when they slammed
into the wall of the fort. Explosive shells from the rifles also played
an important part in reducing the work.</p>

<p class='c004'>The guns and mortars in the Federal batteries were served by detachments
from the 7th Connecticut Volunteers, the 3rd Rhode Island
Volunteer Artillery, the 46th New York State Volunteers, and the 8th
Maine Volunteers. On the second day of the bombardment 100 sailors
from the frigate <i>Wabash</i> manned four of the 30-pounder Parrott rifles
in Battery Sigel. The accuracy of fire achieved by the gunners in the
2-day battle is remarkable in view of the fact that none of them, except
the sailors, had had previous experience in firing.</p>

</div>

<p class='c003'>The quick reduction of Fort Pulaski took the world by surprise, and,
until the details of the battle were available, many people regarded the
surrender with suspicion. In the circumstances, however, Olmstead’s
decision was wise. Nothing but glory could have been obtained by
prolonging the battle, and many additional lives might have been lost.
When the Confederates gave up Tybee Island, they abandoned Pulaski
to its fate, for they presented the Union forces with the only possible
battery sites from which the fort could have been reduced. When
Olmstead raised the white flag, the Federals were already preparing
an assault, and within 24 hours they could have thrown more than
10,000 troops against the fort. Opposed by such odds, the handful of
men on Cockspur, no matter how brave they might have been, could
have staged but a brief and pointless resistance.</p>

<p class='c004'>Pulaski’s captured garrison was sent North to Governor’s Island in
New York Harbor, where the officers were confined in Fort Columbus;
the men, in Castle Williams. Three months later the officers were transferred
to Johnson’s Island near Sandusky, Ohio, and the men, to
Fort Delaware. Many of the prisoners died of pneumonia or typhoid
fever and a considerable number of the privates, because of family
connections in the Northern States or lack of sympathy with the Confederate
cause, took the oath of allegiance to the United States. In
August, most of the men were exchanged at Aiken’s Landing on the
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>James River, 12 miles from Richmond, Va., and were soon back in
Savannah. The officers were exchanged in September at Vicksburg,
Miss.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The honor of being the first Federal troops to garrison Fort Pulaski
after the surrender was given to the 7th Connecticut Regiment, one
company of the 3rd Rhode Island Heavy Artillery, and a detachment
of the Volunteer Engineers. On June 1 the 7th Connecticut was relieved
by the 48th New York, which remained on Cockspur until May 31,
1863. The so-called honor of garrison duty was tempered with hard
work, for, during the months following the battle, the troops were
detailed to repair the damage caused by the bombardment. The batteries
on Tybee Island were dismantled and some of the guns were
added to the armament of the fort. To ease the tedium of life on a
small island, the 48th New York organized a baseball team, a band,
and a dramatic association, and the wives of some of the officers came
to live on Cockspur.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>The war continued actively on other fronts, slowly turning against
the South. Weeks, months, and years passed. In June 1863 Pulaski’s
garrison was reduced to a holding force. Great battles were fought
elsewhere—Vicksburg, Gettysburg, Chickamauga, Chattanooga, Lookout
Mountain, Missionary Ridge, the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and
Kennesaw Mountain. In September 1864, Gen. William Tecumseh
Sherman took Atlanta after a long and bloody siege and prepared to
march to Savannah through the breadbasket of the Confederate States.</p>

  <span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>
  <h2 id='immortal' class='c009'><span class='xlarge'>“<i>The Immortal Six Hundred</i>”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Late in October 1864, Fort Pulaski became involved in one of the most
barbaric episodes of the Civil War when more than 500 prisoners of
war—Confederate officers of rank from lieutenant to lieutenant
colonel—were brought to Cockspur from a stockade on Morris Island
in Charleston Harbor. These officers, captured in battle and representing
every Southern State and the border States of Missouri, Maryland,
and Kentucky, were the victims of a cruel policy of retaliation and are
known in Southern history as “The Immortal Six Hundred.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The dismal story began at Charleston when Confederate Gen.
Samuel Jones, in an attempt to lift the bombardment of that city,
adopted a dangerous stratagem of using prisoners of war as a shield.
On June 13, 1864, Jones notified Union Gen. J. G. Foster, Commandant
of the Department of the South, that 5 generals and 45 field
officers of the U. S. Army had been quartered in a part of the city which
for many months had been exposed night and day to the fire of Federal
guns. Foster immediately retaliated by requesting that 55 Confederate
Officers of equal rank be sent from the prison at Fort Delaware to be
placed in a stockade on Morris Island under the guns of Fort Sumter.</p>

<p class='c004'>This ugly situation was ended by a general exchange of the officers
on August 3, but on that day Jones placed 600 more Federal officers
in the residential section of Charleston, which was under bombardment.
Federal reaction was prompt. Six hundred additional Confederate
officers were sent down from Fort Delaware and this time they
were placed in the stockade on Morris Island under the guns of Fort
Sumter.</p>

<p class='c004'>What benefit Jones really expected to derive from his strategy is
certainly not clear. There is evidence that he soon regretted the game
he was playing and made every effort possible to have the Federal
officers moved out of Charleston, but, due to the fortunes of war, Jones
was powerless to stop the chain of events he had started. He could not
get rid of his unwelcome guests, and, as General Sherman, poised for
his march through Georgia, threatened the security of the Confederate
prison at Andersonville, Ga., hundreds of new Federal prisoners sent
from that place began to arrive in Charleston every day.</p>

<p class='c004'>In October, Fate intervened. Yellow fever, which had been smoldering
in Charleston for many weeks, became epidemic, and the acute
danger from this source gave Jones the excuse to remove the prisoners
without authority from his superiors. He sent the officers to Columbia
and the men to Florence. On learning of this move, Foster ordered the
Confederate prisoners from Morris Island to Fort Pulaski.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>When the “Immortal Six Hundred” arrived at Cockspur Island, they
presented a forlorn picture. Uniforms in tatters, barefooted, suffering
from diarrhea and hacking coughs, their ranks had already been reduced
to 520. Forty-nine were in hospitals, 4 had escaped, 2 had been
exchanged, and 2 had taken the oath of allegiance. Six were in a convict
prison on Hilton Head Island for attempted escape, 13 were
unaccounted for, and 4 were buried in the sands of Morris Island.</p>

<p class='c004'>At Fort Pulaski, Col. Philip P. Brown, Jr., commandant of the post,
greeted the prisoners and promised to make the fort the model military
prison of the United States. He said that he had already requisitioned
blankets and clothing, full army rations, and plenty of fuel.</p>

<p class='c004'>Colonel Brown, 157th New York Volunteers, was a completely
humane man and won the respect of his Confederate prisoners, but
he could not carry out the promises he had made. His requisitions
were ignored. In consequence, he could issue neither blankets nor
clothing. Out of his garrison supplies he fed the prisoners as well as he
could, but fuel on Cockspur was scarce and fires in the cookstoves
could be lighted but once a day. When the weather turned cold there
was neither wood nor coal to heat the prison casemates. Because of his
attitude of humanity, Brown drew upon himself the censure of his
commanding general.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>On December 15, Brown was ordered to impose a starvation ration
composed of one-quarter pound of bread, 10 ounces of cornmeal, and
one-half pint of pickles daily, and 1 ounce of salt every 5 days. Under
this new order prisoners were permitted to secure additional food from
sutlers, but since they had no money and were not allowed to receive
funds from the Confederate States, they could purchase no food.</p>

<p class='c004'>For 43 days in the coldest months of an unusually severe winter,
the prisoners at Pulaski subsisted on this cornmeal and pickle diet.
Cats and dogs that strayed through the prison bars were immediately
cooked and eaten. But day by day the men grew weaker. At night,
with no blankets and no warming fires, they had to keep moving
about or freeze. By mid-January 1865, scurvy began to take its toll.</p>

<p class='c004'>Meanwhile, Savannah had surrendered to General Sherman, and
as a result the Federal forces in the far South were entirely reorganized.
On January 21, Fort Pulaski became a part of the District of Savannah
under the command of Bvt. Maj. Gen. Cuvier Grover, U. S. Volunteers,
and, on January 27, following an inspection by Grover’s medical director,
Pulaski’s prisoners were put back on full rations. This timely
action saved the lives of many of the men. On March 5 the long ordeal
was ended. Four hundred and sixty-five survivors of the original
“Six Hundred” were returned to Fort Delaware.</p>

</div>

<p class='c003'>Now the actors come on stage for the final curtain in the drama of
Fort Pulaski! Sherman had rested in Savannah and had gone north
through the Carolinas to Bentonville and Durham. Grant had met
Lee at Appomattox. The defenders of Fort Sumter had laid down
their arms. The Confederate armies had been crushed on the battlefields.
Gillmore had returned to command the Department of the
South, and the destiny of Fort Pulaski was again in his hands.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>On April 29, 1865, 200 guns were fired from the ramparts of Fort
Pulaski to mark the surrender of General Lee—the end of a great
military career which had begun on Cockspur Island more than 35
years before.</p>

<p class='c004'>A few weeks later the conquering forces captured the President of
the Confederate States. In command of the detail which took Mr.
Davis was Brig. Gen. J. H. Wilson, of the Topographical Engineers,
who 3 years before had brought to Fort Pulaski the demand for surrender.
Mr. Davis was captured in middle Georgia and sent down
the Savannah River to Hilton Head Island for transport to Fortress
Monroe. Accused of complicity in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln
and under orders to be treated as a dangerous criminal, the
Confederate president spent his last night in Georgia aboard ship in
the lee of Cockspur Island. Next morning as he was brought to Hilton
Head, Negroes, lining the shores of the islands, chanted “We’ll hang
Jeff Davis to the sour apple tree!”</p>

<p class='c004'>To the grim fort on Cockspur Island were brought leaders of the
Confederacy, some to remain many months in prison, while an angry
nation sought the illusive satisfaction of vengeance. In the list of distinguished
prisoners were 3 cabinet officers: Secretary of State Robert
M. T. Hunter, Secretary of the Treasury George A. Trenholm, and
Secretary of War James A. Seddon, as well as Assistant Secretary of
War John A. Campbell. In addition, there were 3 State governors,
Andrew G. Magrath of South Carolina, Andrew B. Moore of Alabama,
and Alexander K. Allison of Florida; 1 senator, David L. Yulee
of Florida; and Brig. Gen. Hugh W. Mercer, who as colonel of the
1st Regiment of Georgia had once been in command of Fort Pulaski.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>The Confederacy had been defeated and the streets of Savannah
were patrolled by blue-clad soldiers, but the spirit of the men and
women, who more than 4 years before had demanded the seizure of
Fort Pulaski, was still unbroken. The stores were all open. Business
of every sort progressed precisely as usual. The streets were filled with
native citizens, dressed somewhat antiquely, but giving no sign of
suffering. A smart sailor from a Federal gunboat summed up the
scene, “Hell,” he said, “this town isn’t dead; it’s wound up and
running.” “It was the rebel Savannah unchanged,” wrote Whitelaw
Reid, the famous war correspondent.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='after1865' class='c009'><span class='xlarge'><i>Cockspur Island After 1865</i></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>With the return of peace, the Corps of Engineers under the direction
of General Gillmore undertook to modernize and strengthen Fort
Pulaski. Between the years 1869 and 1872, they remodeled the demilune,
constructing underground magazines and passageways and
emplacements for heavy guns. Major changes were also planned for
the main fortification, but, after digging a huge excavation in the
north end of the parade ground and laying massive concrete piers, the
job was abandoned. Proposals were already under consideration for a
new coast artillery post on Tybee Island, which would take the place
of Fort Pulaski.</p>

<p class='c004'>After 1872 no further active military use of the fort was ever made,
except briefly during the Spanish-American War when a small force
was garrisoned there to man the guns that had been installed in the
demilune and at Battery Horace Hambright, on the north shore of the
island, and to operate the controls for electric mines in the mouth of the
Savannah River. For many years the only inhabitants of the fort were
an ordnance sergeant and a lightkeeper. After the great hurricane of
1891, when the sea rose 5 feet over the parade ground, a 2-story house
for the lightkeeper was erected on the top of the fort.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the first years of the 20th century, Fort Pulaski and the eastern
part of Cockspur Island were totally abandoned. The moat around the
fort and demilune filled with mud from the river; the tides swept over
the neglected dikes and flooded the low-lying marshes. The parade
ground became a veritable jungle and hundreds of snakes made their
homes in the innumerable crevices in the fort’s masonry. Infrequent
parties of zealous hunters and hardy pilgrims, willing to wade through
the soft marsh, were the only visitors.</p>

<p class='c003'>Decontamination facilities to receive German prisoners of war were
prepared in 1918 at the U. S. Quarantine Station on the west end of
Cockspur Island, but the war ended before this installation was put
to use.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>Meanwhile, the War Department took the first step toward the
preservation of Fort Pulaski, announcing on July 17, 1915, that this
fortification had been selected to be a national monument under the
American Antiquities Act. Further action was delayed by World War
I. In 1918, Col. John Millis, District Engineer at Savannah, visited Fort
Pulaski and was so impressed by the magnificence of the ruin that he
recommended immediate preservation. The next district engineer,
Col. F. W. Alstaetter, was equally interested in the project, and, largely
through his efforts, the Savannah Board of Trade and other organizations
began to seek national monument status for the fort. On January
7, 1924, Representative Charles G. Edwards, 1st District of Georgia,
introduced a bill in Congress to bring about this desired result. The
efforts of these individuals and organizations were rewarded on October
15, 1924, when Fort Pulaski was made a national monument by
proclamation of President Calvin Coolidge.</p>

<p class='c004'>The fort remained in desolate condition, however, until 1933 when
the national monument was transferred by the War Department to the
Department of the Interior, and the National Park Service began the
development of the area.</p>

<p class='c004'>The plan adopted in the restoration of Fort Pulaski was not to
reproduce any one definite period in the history of the fortification,
but rather to protect the structure from further deterioration by making
essential repairs and to restore only where necessary to illustrate the use
and history of certain features of the fort.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>Original plans and specifications were available in the files of the
War Department for practically all of the items of restoration and
repair work undertaken. The restoration of the fort and the development
of the national monument were accomplished with funds provided
by the Public Works Administration and through the labor of
the Civilian Conservation Corps. In 1938, Cockspur Island was joined
to McQueens Island by the construction of a bridge across the South
Channel of the Savannah River. From 1942 to 1947 the fort was closed
to the public, when Cockspur Island, as the site of a Navy Section Base,
again became an active part of the defense system of the United States.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>Fort Pulaski is a large-scale outdoor exhibit. The main structure,
together with outlying works, including demilune, drawbridges,
ditches, and dikes, is a fine example of past military architecture. As
a vivid reminder of past events it presents an important phase of our
great national heritage.</p>

<p>FORT PULASKI SELF-GUIDED TOUR PLAN</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>
  <h2 id='guide' class='c009'><span class='xlarge'><i>Guide to the Area</i></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>Fort Pulaski, resembling a medieval castle, is surrounded by a wide
moat, with two drawbridges, and a rear fortification known as a
demilune. After crossing the outer drawbridge, a short walk through
the demilune will bring you to the second drawbridge and the sally
port or only entrance into the main fortification.</p>

<p class='c004'>Numbered markers have been placed at significant points of interest.
These markers correspond with the numbers of the text below and
with those shown on the guide map. They should be followed in
consecutive order.</p>

<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>1. <span class='fss'>THE SALLY PORT.</span> The fort entrance is equipped with many devices
for last-ditch defense. The massive drawbridge, weighing several tons,
is raised by winches and counterweights which may be seen in the
rooms on either side of the entrance. As the drawbridge rises, a strong
wooden grill, called the portcullis, drops through a slot in the granite
lintel overhead. The heart-pine doors are studded with iron bolts to
make it difficult to chop through them with axes. Within the sally port
are two recesses for the protection of guards and 10 slits, or loopholes,
through the side walls for small arms fire. In time of great danger, the
inner doors could also be shut and barred.</p>

<p class='c004'>2. <span class='fss'>THE GORGE.</span> The western, or rear, section of Fort Pulaski is known
as the gorge (“throat”) because it contains the sally port, or entrance
of the fort. The living quarters are also in the gorge. Enlisted men
occupied the barracks rooms, or casemates, to the north of the entrance;
officers were quartered in the casemates to the south of the entrance.
The word casemate means a bomb-proof shelter. Each of the arched
chambers surrounding the parade ground is a casemate. During the
Civil War, when a large number of troops was stationed at Fort Pulaski,
most of the enlisted men were quartered in the casemated gun galleries
or in tents. Originally, all of the casemates were closed in with wooden
fronts to provide shelter from rain and cold. The parade ground, on
which the men exercised and drilled, is 2½ acres in extent. The covered
veranda, which runs the length of the gorge, is an unusual feature in
fort architecture.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>3. <span class='fss'>BARRACKS ROOMS.</span> When Georgia troops seized Fort Pulaski in 1861,
the barracks rooms were unfurnished. The Confederates built triple-decker
bunks against the walls and filled mattress covers with hay
from the parade ground. They brought chairs, tables, and camp cots
from their homes in Savannah. After the surrender, Federal troops
added many items of furniture obtained by raiding plantations along
the coast. The rooms were lighted by candles, coal-oil lanterns, and
lamps. The large fireplace in each room was equipped with a crane
and other devices for cooking, but both Confederate and Union soldiers
did most of their cooking on field ranges. While walking through the
barracks rooms, note how the loopholes in the rear wall are variously
angled to give a wide range of fire.</p>

<p class='c004'>4. <span class='fss'>THE NORTH MAGAZINE.</span> On the second day of the bombardment
Federal projectiles, exploding near the entrance to this powder magazine,
threatened to blow up the Confederates with their own powder.
The interior walls of the magazine are from 12 to 15 feet thick.</p>

<p class='c004'>5. <span class='fss'>THE NORTHWEST BASTION.</span> A bastion is a part of a fort which extends
out from the main wall, with embrasures and loopholes to permit
lateral fire along the walls. Fort Pulaski had only demibastions, or
half bastions, as they extend out only in one direction and give protection
to only one wall. The rectangular openings through the outer
walls of the fort are embrasures to permit the firing of cannon. The
embrasures in the bastions are angled to bring a crossfire on the main
drawbridge and on the point of the demilune. The slot under each
embrasure was to receive the tongue of a gun carriage which was then
held in place by a large iron pin dropped through the round hole in
the floor of the embrasure. The openings in the ceiling above the
embrasures are smoke vents. The circular grooves in the floor originally
held iron tracks on which the wheels of the gun carriages turned.
The slots and grilled trapdoors in the floors of the casemates are to
provide ventilation under the floors. The round pegs in the floor cover
iron spikes that hold the planks in place and originally served to
reduce the hazard of a powder explosion when the guns were in use.
Hobnails in soldiers’ boots on contact with exposed spikes might have
resulted in a dangerous shower of sparks.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>6. <span class='fss'>THE GUN GALLERIES.</span> The casemated gun galleries, which surround
the parade ground on four sides and give to Fort Pulaski the atmosphere
of a cloistered monastery, contain fine examples of brick masonry.
The arches were constructed over wooden forms, each brick being
hand cut to fit its special place. The joints were mortared from above
and, when the arches were firm and strong, the wooden forms were
removed.</p>

<p class='c004'>7. <span class='fss'>THE WATER SYSTEM.</span> Under the brick pavements, which replace
the wooden floors in the two center casemates of each gallery, are
water cisterns. There are 10 of these cisterns, or storage tanks, in the
fort, each capable of holding 20,000 gallons of water. During rainstorms,
water falling on the top of the fort seeps through about 3 feet
of earth and a foot of oyster shell until it reaches the lead-covered
brick roof, whence it is diverted through pipes to the cisterns. Overflow
water from the roof emerges through weep holes between the
arches high on the walls facing the parade ground.</p>

<p class='c004'>8. <span class='fss'>THE TERREPLEIN.</span> The flat surface on top of the rampart of the fort
is called the terreplein and contains brick and granite platforms for
mounting guns. From this high level, guns had a range of fire greater
than those mounted in the casemates below. The breast-high parapet
on the outer edge of the terreplein was for the protection of both guns
and gun crews. The recesses in the parapet wall were to allow gun
carriages to swing freely.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>9. <span class='fss'>TERREPLEIN, EAST ANGLE.</span> From this point a good view may be obtained
of the shore of Tybee Island, from which the fort was bombarded.
The two batteries containing the 10 James and Parrott rifled
guns, which did the principal damage to the fort, were located on the
western point of Tybee just north of the present highway bridge. The
9 other batteries of mortars and siege guns were at various places along
the shore for 2 miles in the direction of the lighthouse. The small brick
lighthouse on Cockspur Point was built about 1840 and therefore was
a feature of the landscape at the time of the bombardment.</p>

<p class='c004'>10. <span class='fss'>THE PRISON.</span> From October 23, 1864, to March 4, 1865, the northeast,
southeast, and part of the south casemates of Fort Pulaski were
used as a military prison.</p>

<p class='c004'>11. <span class='fss'>THE BREACH.</span> In three casemates at the southeast angle there are
solid brick walls without embrasures. These walls were constructed
in 1862, after the surrender, by troops of the 48th New York Volunteers
to close the breach, or opening, made by the Federal shot and
shell during the bombardment.</p>

<p class='c004'>12. <span class='fss'>THE SOUTHWEST BASTION.</span> The interior of the southwest bastion
was destroyed by fire in 1893. This part of the fort has been left unrestored
to show details of the foundation construction. All arches are
completed beneath the floor level and are laid on a platform of yellow
pine timbers, called grillage. The grillage in turn is supported by
yellow pine piles which are driven deep into the mud of Cockspur
Island.</p>

<p class='c004'>13. <span class='fss'>HEADQUARTERS (SURRENDER ROOM).</span> The surrender of Fort Pulaski
was executed in the quarters of Col. Charles H. Olmstead, Confederate
commander. In 1925 a lightning fire destroyed the officers’ quarters.
This room was restored in 1935.</p>

<p class='c004'>14. <span class='fss'>CISTERN ROOM.</span> This room, also destroyed in the 1925 fire, has been
left unrestored to show construction details. The cylindrical brick
structure below floor level is the top of a water cistern.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>15. <span class='fss'>BOTTLE COLLECTION.</span> Nearly 1,000 bottles were found in the Fort
Pulaski moat when the mud was cleaned out in 1935. These bottles
had been thrown into the moat by workmen building the fort and by
Confederate and Union soldiers during the Civil War. A part of the
collection is shown in this room.</p>

<p class='c004'>16. <span class='fss'>THE MOAT.</span> The wet ditch, or moat, which completely surrounds
the main fortification and the demilune, varies in width from 30 to
48 feet. It has an average depth of 7 feet. The water, brought through a
canal from the South Channel of the Savannah River, is controlled
through a series of tide gates. Fish, crabs, shrimp, oysters, and turtles
live in the moat.</p>

<p class='c004'>17. <span class='fss'>THE DEMILUNE.</span> The outwork often found at the rear of a large
fortification was originally constructed in a half-moon shape—hence
the name demilune. The principal earthworks in the demilune were
built in 1869, after the Civil War, and contain four powder magazines
and passageways connecting gun emplacements. The detached mound
of earth near the entrance to the demilune was erected in 1893 to protect
an underground chamber in which were placed the controls for
electric mines in the main channel of the Savannah River. This room
is kept locked today as it contains a large and dangerous electric
transformer.</p>

<p class='c004'>18. <span class='fss'>DAMAGED WALL.</span> Evidence of the bombardment can best be seen
from the outside of the fort. The breach through the southeast angle
was repaired in 1862 with a bright-red brick, which, in contrast to the
original brown brick, shows the area of the damage wrought by the
siege guns. The southeastern wall facing Tybee is pock-marked by
shell hits, and many of the balls and projectiles are still embedded in
the brickwork.</p>

<div class='ic042'>
<p><b><i>The damaged wall.</i></b></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>19. <span class='fss'>THE CEMETERY.</span> On the glacis, or north bank of the demilune moat,
a small cemetery was established when the fort was under construction.
Here, during the Civil War, both Confederate and Union soldiers were
temporarily buried. The 8-inch columbiad, which marks the site, was
a Confederate gun damaged in the bombardment.</p>

<p class='c004'>20. <span class='fss'>THE WAVING GIRL.</span> Just after the Civil War a girl was born on
Cockspur Island in the former quarters of the engineer officers. The
child was named Florence Martus, and her father was an ordnance
sergeant at Fort Pulaski. From the stone pier on the north shore of
Cockspur Island young Florence first saw the passing ships going with
cargoes to the farthest corners of the earth. The small child was
fascinated by these gay ships and waved her handkerchief. Sailors on
the ships waved back. A few years later, the child, then in her ’teens,
went to live with her brother, a light keeper, in a white cottage close
by the riverbank, about 5 miles up river from Fort Pulaski. From this
time on she waved at every ship that passed—a table cloth or towel
by day, a lantern by night. For more than 44 years she never missed a
ship, and each ship, as it passed, returned her salute with three blasts
of the whistle. Many stories were told of this small girl, who finally
grew to be a white-haired old lady. These legends of the Waving Girl
of Savannah are known in all the seas where ships have sailed.</p>
